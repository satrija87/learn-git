My heart will go on
 Увеличить шрифт Уменьшить шрифт
Моё сердце будет биться
Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on.

Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on.

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more, you opened the door
And you're here in my heart,
And my heart will go on and on.

Love was when I loved you,
One true time I hold to
In my life we'll always go on.

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more, you opened the door
And you're here in my heart,
And my heart will go on and on.

You're here, there's nothing I fear
And I know that my heart will go on.
We'll stay, forever this way
You are safe in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
